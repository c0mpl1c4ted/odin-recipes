    <img src="../media/spaghetti_carbonara.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish made with simple, high-quality ingredients. Creamy without using cream, the sauce is created from eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta (or guanciale), and freshly ground black pepper. It's rich, savory, and deeply satisfying—perfect for a quick yet luxurious meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks + 1 whole egg</li>
        <li>50g (1.75 oz) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt, for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Boil the pasta</em> <ul>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti until al dente (firm to the bite), according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>Prepare the sauce</em><ul>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, grated Pecorino Romano, and a generous amount of black pepper until smooth and creamy. Set aside.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>Cook the pancetta or guanciale </em><ul>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta or guanciale until it becomes crispy and golden brown. This takes about 5–7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat once cooked but leave the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>Combine pasta and sauce</em> <ul>
            <li>Add the drained hot spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss well to combine and let it cool just slightly (about 30 seconds off the heat).</li>
            <li>Pour the egg-cheese mixture over the pasta while tossing quickly to prevent scrambling the eggs. Add a bit of the reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, to loosen the sauce and make it glossy and smooth.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>Serve</em> <ul>
            <li>Plate immediately and top with extra Pecorino Romano and freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol>
